## Setting up Python API for Emotion Analysis

* Deploy the code on Linode instance.
* Use `ngrok` to port forward from the Linode instance, to localhost the Jupyter environment for working on the code.
* Once done, run the API by running `python3 api-emotion.py` which will run this on localhost within the Linode instance.
* Use `ngrok` to pass the parameter of the url instance and get the response. Example:

```

```

## Uploading image to Linode Bucket

* Replace the access keys, and regions in `bucket-upload.py`
* Run the python file, and use `ngrok` to port forward from the Linode Instance to do a post method to upload files.
* Use the image parameter to add the desired image to upload.

Example: 

```
http -f POST http://localhost:5000/upload image@path/to/image.jpg

```
